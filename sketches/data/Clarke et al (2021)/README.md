Due to the simplicity of the primary data, the [`.Rmd` file](https://github.com/ASKurz/Experimental-design-and-the-GLMM/blob/main/sketches/Clarke%20et%20al%20(2021).Rmd) for the content sketch for Clarke et al (2021) reproduces the data with a hand-computed tibble (see [here](https://github.com/ASKurz/Experimental-design-and-the-GLMM/blob/main/sketches/Clarke-et-al--2021-.md)). However, these two `.xlsx` files and the `.docx` file are nice supplements. They were downloaded from the OSF (https://osf.io/pr8zu/) on June 27, 2022.
