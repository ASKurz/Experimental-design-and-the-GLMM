The primary GitHub repo for Gaffney et al (2020) is at [https://github.com/michaelrgaffney/signaling2020mturk](https://github.com/michaelrgaffney/signaling2020mturk). However, the data themselves are in another repo at [https://github.com/michaelrgaffney/signaling2020data](https://github.com/michaelrgaffney/signaling2020data). I cloned both repos on July 17, 2023, and the primary data file is `signaling2020.rda`. Based on some of the script files in the `signaling2020mturk` repo, the authors did a few important data-cleaning steps, including filtering out the cases for which `CompleteSurvey == FALSE`. Based on my inspection, this seems largely fine, but it's not 100% cut and dry and it would probably make sense to eventually make a separate Markdown script where I explicitly wrangle the `signaling2020.rda` data into the `gaffney2020` data. Until then, the file for the initial content sketch will have to do.
