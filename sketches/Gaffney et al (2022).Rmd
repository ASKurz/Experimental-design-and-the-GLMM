Gaffney et al (2022; [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2022.02.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2022.02.004)) used a pretest-posttest $4 \times 5$ between-person factorial design to compare competing theories on depression and suicidal behaviors. The authors made the code and data from their paper available on the OSF. The `signaling2020mturk` repository contains their code (see [here](https://github.com/michaelrgaffney/signaling2020mturk)) and the `signaling2020data`  repository contains their data (see [here](https://github.com/michaelrgaffney/signaling2020data)). Here we load their primary data, the `signaling2020.rda` file.

I'm publishing this content sketch just a couple weeks after the [*Barbie* movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/) dropped. In response of the movie's cultural and financial success, [Matthew B. Jan√©](https://matthewbjane.com) made a custom `theme_barbie()` setting, which eventually grew into the **ThemePark** package (see [here](https://github.com/MatthewBJane/theme_park)). So this sketch will take `theme_barbie()` for its default plot setting, with a few minor adjustments.

```{r}
# install from GitHub
# remotes::install_github("MatthewBJane/theme_park")

# load
library(ThemePark)

# adjust the default plot theme settings
theme_set(
  theme_barbie(barbie_font = FALSE) +
    # a few minor adjustments
    theme(title = element_text(size = 12),
          axis.text = element_text(size = 9),
          axis.title = element_text(size = 11),
          legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
          legend.key = element_rect(fill = barbie_theme_colors["panel"], 
                                    color = barbie_theme_colors["panel"]),
          strip.text = element_text(size = 9, margin = margin(2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5)))

Here are a couple data wrangling steps based on some of Gaffney and colleagues' GitHub files.

```{r}
# unclear, but I think they omitted code defining d, which I believe is this:
gaffney2022 <- signaling2020 %>% 
  filter(CompleteSurvey == TRUE) %>% 
  # from analysls.R file
  mutate(
    across(.cols = c(contains('Belief'), contains('Action')), ~.x/100),
    signal = ordered(signal, levels = c('Verbal request', 'Crying', 'Mild depression', 'Depression', 'Suicide attempt'))
  )
```

The number of participants per group range from 58 to 67. Here's how you might display those counts in a grid.

```{r}
gaffney2022 %>% 
  count(signal, vignette) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = vignette, values_from = n)
```

Participants were randomized into the two factor variables `signal` and `vignette`, the combination of which make up the 20 conditions in the study. The `vignette` factor was unordered, and the four levels provide different contexts in which a female made a claim about adversity that involved some conflict of interest. For example, in the `Basketball coach` example:

> Participants were asked to imagine that they are a university athletic director. The star player on the women's basketball team comes to the participant and claims she was sexually assaulted by her head coach, a physically powerful man. However, there is a history of conflict between the star player and the coach over playing time, and police are unable to find evidence to corroborate her claims. (p. 247)

After reading their assigned vignette, participants rated how likely they would help the person in the vignette on a 0-to-100 scale. The `T1Action` variable is that scale, rescaled to a 0-1 metric, and this was considered the baseline measurement. Then participants were there randomized into one of the levels of the `signal` factor. These involved an extension of the vignette where they encountered the victim sometime later and observed them exhibiting one of the levels of the `signal`. The `signal` factor is ordered by the degree of the vignette's emotional intensity whereby the `Verbal request` condition was the low-emotional signaling control condition, and the `Suicide attempt` condition was meant to convey a strong emotional signal. Thus all levels of `signal` other than `Verbal request` were conceptualized as active treatment conditions. Then after reading through this second part of the vignette, participants once again rated their willingness to help the person on a 0-to-100 scale, the rescaled version of which is the primary outcome in this content sketch, `T2Action`.

In the original study, there were two focal outcomes: `T2Belief` and `T2Action`. In this post, we'll restrict ourselves to the later. Here we plot the pretest version of those values, `T1Action`, by the 20 cells in the study.

```{r, fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 5.5}
gaffney2022 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = T1Action)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = medium_color_barbie,
                 boundary = 0, binwidth = 0.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:3 / 3, labels = c("0", "1/3", "2/3", "1")) +
  ggtitle("Behold the pretest version of the primary outcome, T2Action.") +
  facet_grid(vignette ~ signal)
```

Given the `TxAction` variables are "beta" distributed (see below), we won't compute their Pearson's correlation coefficient. But they are strongly positively related, which we can see in a scatter plot.

```{r, fig.height = 3.5}
gaffney2022 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = T1Action, y = T2Action)) +
  geom_abline(color = "white") +
  geom_point(color = medium_color_barbie, alpha = 1/2) +
  coord_equal() +
  ggtitle("Strong, positive, and non-linear")
```

### Standardize.

Given the complexity of the models to follow, the `T1Action` variable will be the sole baseline covariate in this content sketch. However, it might be easier to set some of our priors if we convert this variable to a standardized metric. We'll save that variable as `T1Actionz`.

```{r}
gaffney2022 <- gaffney2022 %>% 
  mutate(T1Actionz = (T1Action - mean(T1Action)) / sd(T1Action))
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
fit0 <- brm(
  data = gaffney2022,
  family = zero_one_inflated_beta(),
  bf(T2Action ~ 1 + s(T1Actionz),
     phi ~ 1 + s(T1Actionz),
     zoi ~ 1 + s(T1Actionz),
     coi ~ 1 + s(T1Actionz)),
   prior = prior(exponential(1), class = sds) +
    prior(exponential(2), class = sds, dpar = phi) +
    prior(exponential(1), class = sds, dpar = zoi) +
    prior(exponential(1), class = sds, dpar = coi),
  cores = 4, seed = 1
)

conditional_smooths(fit0)

nd <- tibble(T1Actionz = seq(from = min(gaffney2022$T1Actionz), to = max(gaffney2022$T1Actionz), length.out = 100)) %>% 
  mutate(T1Action = (T1Actionz * sd(gaffney2022$T1Action)) + mean(gaffney2022$T1Action))

fitted(fit0, newdata = nd) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = T1Action)) +
  geom_abline(color = "white") +
  geom_point(data = gaffney2022,
             aes(y = T2Action),
             color = medium_color_barbie, alpha = 1/3, size = 1/2) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Q2.5, ymax = Q97.5),
              fill = dark_color_barbie, alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Estimate),
            color = dark_color_barbie) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_barbie(barbie_font = F)
```

## Models

Our focal outcome variable `T2Action` is continuous and ranges from zero to one. If it were constrained to values between those bounds, $[0, 1]$, these data would be a great candidate for beta regression. However, these data also include exact zero's and ones, which puts them on the $(0, 1)$ range. To accommodate those values, we'll switch to the zero-one-inflated beta (ZOIB) likelihood ([Swearingen et al., 2012](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7548f25e1f5902955dd3284ba8a410d117eaa78e)). Before we dive into our primary ZOIB models, we'll first introduce the ZOIB with two simpler warm-up models. After our warm-ups, we'll fit three primary models:

* a fixed-effects ANCOVA,
* a hierarchical ANCOVA, and
* a fixed-effects ANCOVA with a monotonic factor.

All three primary models will be fully distributional, with linear models for all four ZOIB distributional parameters.

### Warm up without predictors.

To warm up, we'll first fit an unconditional ZOIB model of the form

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{T2Action}_i & \sim \text{ZOIB}(\mu, \phi, \alpha, \gamma) \\
\text{logit}(\mu) & = \beta_0 \\ 
\beta_0 & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1.25) \\
\phi & \sim \text{Lognormal}(3.469746, 0.57937949) \\
\alpha & \sim \text{Beta}(1, 9) \\
\gamma & \sim \text{Beta}(5, 5) \\
\end{align*}
$$

where we use the logit link for $\mu$ and the identity link for the remaining three parameters, all of which are the `brm()` defaults. With this parameterization, $\beta_0$ is the unconditional mean, on the log-odds scale. Here we're using my go-to default weakly-regularizing prior for log-odds intercepts, $\text{Normal}(0, 1.25)$, which will center $\mu$ at .5 while still allowing for values across the entire $[0, 1]$ parameter space.

The $\text{Lognormal}(3.469746, 0.57937949)$ prior for $\phi$ may seem oddly specific. The $\phi$ parameter is constrained to positive real values, $\mathbb R^+$, and the lognormal is a 2-parameter distribution distribution constrained to that same range. Though we could also a prior from another positive real distribution, such as the exponential or gamma, those will lead to complications for future models. As we will see, once we start fitting fully conditional ZOIB models, `brm()` will switch to the log link for $\phi$, and we typically use Gaussian priors for parameters in linear models using the log link. It turns out that log transforming a lognormal distribution will return a normal distribution, and exponentiating a normal distribution will return a lognormal distribution. Thus, by using a lognormal prior for our unconditional model, we are setting ourselves up to use an equivalent normal prior in the conditional models to come. You'll see. For now, we'll want to see why we've settled on $\text{Lognormal}(3.469746, 0.57937949)$. The lognormal distribution is parameterized in terms of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, which are the population mean and standard deviations *for the normal distribution that results after exponentiation*. Thus if you want a lognormal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation on its own scale, you have to use the following equations

$$
\begin{align*}
\mu & = \log\left ( \bar y \Bigg / \sqrt{\frac{s^2}{\bar y^2} + 1} \right), \text{and} \\
\sigma & = \sqrt{\log \left(\frac{s^2}{\bar y^2} + 1 \right)}.
\end{align*}
$$

where $\bar y$ is the desired mean and $s$ is the desired standard deviation. Here we'll bake those equations into a custom function `lognormal_mu_sigma_from_mean_sd()`, which will return the necessary lognormal $\mu$ and $\sigma$ values for a given mean and standard deviation.

```{r}
lognormal_mu_sigma_from_mean_sd <- function(mean, sd) {
  
  if (mean <= 0) stop("mean must be > 0")
  if (sd   <= 0) stop("sd must be > 0")
  
  mu    <- log(mean / sqrt(sd^2 / mean^2 + 1))
  sigma <- sqrt(log(sd^2 / mean^2 + 1))
  
  return(tibble(mu = mu, sigma = sigma))
  
}
```

Here's what it returns for a mean of 38 and a standard deviation of 24.

```{r}
lognormal_mu_sigma_from_mean_sd(mean = 38, sd = 24)
```

The inner 95% range for a lognormal distribution with those parameters is about 10 to 100, which encapsulates the range of values I'd generally expect from a beta variable in a psychology experiment.

```{r}
qlnorm(c(.025, .975), 3.469746, 0.5793794)
```

Here's that that looks like in a plot.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}
c(prior(lognormal(3.837813, 0.3852532)),
  prior(lognormal(3.469746, 0.57937949))) %>% 
  parse_dist() %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(xdist = .dist_obj, y = prior)) +
  stat_halfeye(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = c(.5, .95),
               fill = light_color_barbie,
               color = dark_color_barbie) +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = expansion(mult = 0.1)) +
  labs(title = expression(italic(p)(phi)),
       x = expression(phi),
       y = NULL) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100))
```

Our focal $\text{Lognormal}(3.469746, 0.57937949)$ prior on the bottom is contrasted with an alternative $\text{Lognormal}(3.837813, 0.3852532)$ prior, which has a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 20 (execute `lognormal_mu_sigma_from_mean_sd(mean = 50, sd = 20)`). You might experiment on your own with the `lognormal_mu_sigma_from_mean_sd()` function to explore other candidates for the $\phi$ prior.

```{r, echo = F, eval = F}
lognormal_mu_sigma_from_mean_sd(mean = 50, sd = 20)
```

We have used the $\text{Beta}(1, 9)$ prior for $\alpha$, which puts our prior mean at 0.1 that the `T2Action` values will be zero's or one's. The concentration for that prior $(1 + 9 = 10)$ is a fairly small value, indicating we're not overly confident. Our $\text{Beta}(5, 5)$ prior for $\gamma$ indicates we expect about a 50/50 split between those zero's and one's, and the small concentration $(5 + 5 = 10)$ indicates we are also unsure about that split. Here are what those priors look like.

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3.5}
c(prior(beta(1, 9)),
  prior(beta(5, 5))) %>% 
  parse_dist() %>% 
  mutate(order = 1:2) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(xdist = .dist_obj, y = order)) +
  stat_halfeye(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = c(.5, .95),
               fill = light_color_barbie,
               color = dark_color_barbie) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:2, labels = c("beta(1, 9)", "beta(5, 5)"),
                     sec.axis = dup_axis(breaks = 1:2,
                                         labels = parse(text = c("alpha", "gamma")))) +
  labs(title = expression(italic(p)(alpha)~and~italic(p)(gamma)),
       subtitle = "Concentrations of 10",
       x = "prior space",
       y = NULL)
```

If you would like stronger or weaker priors with the same means, increase the values for the hyperparameters so they have the same ratio's, but have larger or smaller concentrations, respectively. For example, here's what it looks like if we want our priors to be about half of the strength.

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3.5}
c(prior(beta(0.5,  4.5)),
  prior(beta(2.5, 2.5))) %>% 
  parse_dist() %>% 
  mutate(order = 1:2) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(xdist = .dist_obj, y = order)) +
  stat_halfeye(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = c(.5, .95),
               fill = light_color_barbie,
               color = dark_color_barbie) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:2, labels = c("beta(1, 9)", "beta(5, 5)"),
                     sec.axis = dup_axis(breaks = 1:2,
                                         labels = parse(text = c("alpha", "gamma")))) +
  labs(title = expression(italic(p)(alpha)~and~italic(p)(gamma)),
       subtitle = "Concentrations of 5",
       x = "prior space",
       y = NULL)
```

Here's how to fit the model with `brm()`.

```{r fit1}
fit1 <- brm(
  data = gaffney2022,
  family = zero_one_inflated_beta(),
  T2Action ~ 1,
  prior = prior(normal(0, 1.25), class = Intercept) +
    prior(lognormal(3.469746, 0.57937949), class = phi) +
    prior(beta(1, 9), class = zoi) +
    prior(beta(5, 5), class = coi),
  cores = 4, seed = 1,
  file = "fits/fit1.gaffney2022"
)
```

Check the model summary.

```{r}
print(fit1)
```

We can check how the model did with a histogram-based `pp_check()`.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3.5}
bayesplot::color_scheme_set("pink")

pp_check(fit1, ndraws = 8, type = "hist", binwidth = 0.05)
```

For an unconditional model, we did pretty okay.

We might further practice with the posterior draws from our unconditional ZOIB model to compute the population means and variances. We define the mean of a ZOIB as

$$\mathbb E(y) = \alpha \gamma + \mu (1 - \alpha),$$

and the variance as

$$
\mathbb{Var}(y) = \alpha \gamma (1 - \gamma) + \frac{(1 - \alpha)(\mu - \mu^2)}{\phi + 1} + \alpha(1 - \alpha)(\gamma - \mu)^2.
$$

Further, you can compute the proportion of $0$'s with

$$
p_0 = \alpha (1 - \gamma),
$$

and the proportion of $1$'s with 

$$
p_1 = \alpha\gamma.
$$

Now use those equations to compare the population statistics from the model with the sample statistics.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3.5, warning = F}
stat_order <- c("mean", "variance", "italic(p)[0]", "italic(p)[1]")

# compute sample statistics
sample_stats <- gaffney2022 %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(T2Action),
            variance = var(T2Action),
            `italic(p)[0]` = mean(T2Action == 0),
            `italic(p)[1]` = mean(T2Action == 1)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  mutate(name = factor(name, levels = stat_order))

# extract the posterior draws
as_draws_df(fit1) %>% 
  # wrangle
  transmute(mu = plogis(b_Intercept),
            phi = phi,
            alpha = zoi,
            gamma = coi) %>% 
  mutate(mean     = alpha * gamma + (1 - alpha) * mu,
         variance = alpha * gamma * (1 - gamma) + (1 - alpha) * mu * (1 - mu) / (phi + 1) + alpha * (1 - alpha) * (gamma - mu)^2,
         `italic(p)[0]` = alpha * (1 - gamma),
         `italic(p)[1]` = alpha * gamma) %>% 
  pivot_longer(mean:`italic(p)[1]`) %>% 
  mutate(name = factor(name, levels = stat_order)) %>% 
  
  # plot!
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  stat_halfeye(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = c(.5, .95),
               fill = light_color_barbie,
               color = dark_color_barbie,
               normalize = "panels") +
  geom_vline(data = sample_stats,
             aes(xintercept = value),
             linetype = 2, color = medium_color_barbie) +
  scale_x_continuous("statistic space", expand = expansion(mult = 0.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free", labeller = label_parsed)
```

The posteriors for all four population values are well centered atop the sample statistics, as depicted by the dashed vertical lines.

### Warm up further with a curvy baseline covariate.

Now we have a sense of the unconditional ZOIB model, it's time to talk about baseline covariates. All our primary models will include the standardized version of the baseline measure of our primary outcome variable, `T1Actionz`, as a covariate to improve on the efficiency of our causal estimands. If this were a simple Gaussian model, we could model this using the conventional linear approach. However, our unconditional ZOIB already uses the logit link for $\mu$, and once we start attaching linear models to the other three parameters in the models to come, those will all use non-identity link functions too. If the `T1Action` variable followed a simple beta distribution, it might be fine to just use a logit transformation to follow the logit links, but sadly `T1Action` also has zero and one inflation. Those zero's and one's would result in negative and positive infinity values after the logit transformation, and linear models don't do well when your predictors contain infinity values. So to accommodate any nonlinear relations, we will include `T1Actionz` in a smooth function following the form

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{T2Action}_i & \sim \text{ZOIB}(\mu_i, \phi, \alpha, \gamma) \\
\text{logit}(\mu_i) & = \beta_0 + f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) \\ 
f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) & = \beta_1 \text{T1Actionz}_i + z_j b_j, \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, J\ \text{basis terms}\ (b) \\

\alpha & \sim \text{Beta}(1, 9) \\
\gamma & \sim \text{Beta}(5, 5) \\
\sigma & \sim \text{Exponential}(1),
\end{align*}
$$

where, for the sake of practice, we are only adding the covariate to the $\mu_i$ model at this point. We'll generalize later. In the second line, we have indicated our covariate is in a smooth term with the general function notation $f(\cdot)$. We define that function in the third line, which shows how **brms** uses the multilevel parameterization for smooths. The first term on the right side of the third line, $\beta_1$, is like a fixed effect or grand mean for `T1Actionz`. In the next term, $z_j b_j$, we see there are $j$ synthetic basis functions $b$, each of which has it's own deviation from the $\beta_1$ grand mean allowed by their $z_i$ coefficients. In the fourth line, we see those $z_i$ coefficients are normally distributed with a population mean of zero and standard deviation $\sigma$. The remaining lines spell out our priors, the intercepts for which are the same as before. We have used a generic weakly-regularizing $\text{Normal}(0, 1)$ prior for our new $\beta_1$ and the weakly-regularizing $\text{Exponential}(1)$ prior for $\sigma$.

In code, we will specify our smooth function with the `s()` helper, which **brms** imports from the **mgcv** package. Here we are using the default settings, which means we are using a regularized *thin plate spline* with the number of dimensions (i.e., number of $b$'s) chosen automatically. You can change these settings with the `bs` and `k` arguments.

```{r fit2}
fit2 <- brm(
  data = gaffney2022,
  family = zero_one_inflated_beta(),
  T2Action ~ 1 + s(T1Actionz),
  prior = prior(normal(0, 1.25), class = Intercept) +
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = b) +
    prior(exponential(1), class = sds) +
    prior(lognormal(3.469746, 0.57937949), class = phi) +
    prior(beta(1, 9), class = zoi) +
    prior(beta(5, 5), class = coi),
  cores = 4, seed = 1,
  file = "fits/fit2.gaffney2022"
)
```

Check the model summary.

```{r}
print(fit2)
```

The `sT1Actionz_1` line in the `Population-Level Effects` section shows the summary for $\beta_1$, the fixed effect portion of our thin plate spline. The standard deviaiton among our $z_J$ deviations is displayed in the `sds(sT1Actionz_1)` line of the new `Smooth Terms` section. In the formula, we called that value $\sigma$. Smaller values for $\sigma$ impose greater penalties on wiggliness (i.e., stronger regularization), and as $\sigma \rightarrow \infty$ the spline becomes unconstrained. We can get a sense of the shape of the spline with the `conditional_smooths()` function.

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2.75}
plot(conditional_smooths(fit2), 
     line_args = list(fill = light_color_barbie,
                      color = dark_color_barbie),
     plot = FALSE)[[1]]
```

In this case, the smooth is a little wiggly, but not impressively so, and one might wonder if we'd be better off just using a much simpler liner model. As you'll see very shortly, this won't be the case once we start modeling the other parameters available in the ZOIB distributional model. Hang tight.

### Primary models.

#### Fixed-effects ANCOVA.

Now we have warmed up with the unconditional ZOIB, we are ready to begin fitting our primary models. Our first model will be a distributional ZOIB fixed-effects ANCOVA. Before we describe the statistical model with an equation, we'll first show the basic linear model, excluding the baseline covariate, in the `lm()`-style *design formula* format:

`T2Action ~ 1 + signal + vignette + signal:vignette`

We'll use a similar version of this code within `brm()` because of how convenient and compact it is. However, because both our `signal` and `vignette` variables are composed of more than two categories, the `brm()` function will decompose them into a series of dummy variables, much like with the `lm()` function. Thus a full interaction model of these variables would lead to a linear formula more like

$$
\begin{align*}
\eta & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{signal}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_4 \text{signal}_{5i} \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_5 \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_7 \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_8 \text{signal}_{2i} \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_{19} \text{signal}_{5i} \text{vignette}_{4i},
\end{align*}
$$

where the $\eta$ term on the left side of the equation is the *linear predictor*, which is a compact notation sometimes used for the right-hand side of the equation in a GLMM (see McCullagh & Nelder, 1989, https://tinyurl.com/5cvv36z2; B√ºrkner, 2017, https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v080.i01). With this formulation, $\text{signal}_{1i}$ would indicate the dummy variable for the first category in `signal`, $\text{signal}_{2i}$ would indicate the dummy variable for the second category, and so on. Notice how we exclude dummy variables for the first category in both `signal` and `vignette`, which makes the intercept $\beta_0$ the expected value for the reference category where participants were in the first category of `signal` (*Verbal request*) and the first category for `vignette` (*Basketball coach*). Given the five levels of `signal` and the four levels of `vignette`, the full ANOVA-type interaction model requires $5 \times 4 = 20$ regression coefficients for each parameter in the likelihood. However, we'll want to add the smooth term for our baseline covariate to the model too, which expands the linear predictor to

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
gaffney2022 %>% 
  distinct(signal) %>% 
  arrange(signal)

gaffney2022 %>% 
  distinct(vignette) %>% 
  arrange(vignette)
```

$$
\begin{align*}
\eta & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{signal}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_4 \text{signal}_{5i} \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_5 \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_7 \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_8 \text{signal}_{2i} \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_{19} \text{signal}_{5i} \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) \\
f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) & = \beta_{20} \text{T1Actionz}_i + z_j b_j, \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, J\ \text{basis terms}\ (b) \\
z_j & \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma),
\end{align*}
$$

where what we used to call $\beta_1$ in our last warm-up model, has now become $\beta_{20}$ after accounting for all the coefficients for the dummy versions of our focal variables. Thus one way we might express the full model is

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{T2Action}_i & \sim \text{ZOIB}(\mu_i, \phi_i, \alpha_i, \gamma_i) \\
\text{logit}(\mu_i)    & = \eta^\mu \\
\log(\phi_i)           & = \eta^\phi \\
\text{logit}(\alpha_i) & = \eta^\alpha \\
\text{logit}(\gamma_i) & = \eta^\gamma, \;\;\; \text{where} \\
\eta & = \beta_0  \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_1 \text{signal}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_4 \text{signal}_{5i} \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_5 \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_7 \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_8 \text{signal}_{2i} \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_{19} \text{signal}_{5i} \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) \\
f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) & = \beta_{20} \text{T1Actionz}_i + z_j b_j, \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, J\ \text{basis terms}\ (b) \\
z_j & \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma), \;\;\; \text{and we have the priors} \\
\beta_0^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1.25) \\
\beta_0^\phi & \sim \text{Normal}(3.837813, 0.3852532) \\
\beta_0^\alpha & \sim \text{Normal}(-2.55, 1) \\
\beta_0^\gamma & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.67) \\
\beta_1^\mu, \dots, \beta_{20}^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\beta_1^\phi, \dots, \beta_{20}^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.5) \\
\beta_1^\alpha, \dots, \beta_{20}^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\beta_1^\gamma, \dots, \beta_{20}^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\sigma^\mu & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma^\phi & \sim \text{Exponential}(2) \\
\sigma^\alpha & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma^\gamma & \sim \text{Exponential}(1)
\end{align*}
$$

where the notation of $\eta^\mu$, $\eta^\phi$, $\eta^\alpha$, $\eta^\gamma$, and $\eta$ is my attempt to convey that the linear predictors for all four likelihood terms have a common structure called $\eta$, but the parameters within and across each are allowed to freely vary. Next we discuss priors.

The priors for all non-intercept $\beta$ parameters are meant to be weakly regularizing. Since the parameters in $\beta_{1+}^\mu$, $\beta_{1+}^\alpha$, and $\beta_{1+}^\gamma$ are all on the log-odds scale, they share a common prior distribution of $\text{Normal}(0, 1)$. To my mind, the $\text{Normal}(0, 0.5)$ is often a better weakly-regularizing default for $\beta$ parameters on the log scale, which is why we use those priors for the $\beta_{1+}^\phi$ parameters. The exponential priors for the $\sigma$ parameters for the smooth terms follow a similar default weakly-regularizing logic.

As to the $\beta_0$ intercept parameters, the prior for what we are now calling $\beta_0^\mu$ is the same as the $\beta_0$ prior we used in the two warm-up models. As to the $\beta_0^\phi$ prior, note the `brm()` function defaults to the log link when we attach a linear model to $\phi$. Recall that the log of a normal distribution with hyperparameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ is the same as a lognormal distribution with hyperparameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$. Thus when we use the $\text{Normal}(3.837813, 0.3852532)$ prior for $\beta_0^\phi$ on the log scale, this is equivalent to using the $\text{Lognormal}(3.837813, 0.3852532)$ prior in our earlier warm-up models when the unconditional $\phi$ was on the identity scale.

The priors for our new $\beta_0^\alpha$ and $\beta_0^\gamma$ parameters require a little more explanation. I am not aware of a way to perfectly convert a beta distribution on the probability scale to an unbounded distribution on the log-odds scale. However, with a little iteration I was able to find a couple Gaussian distributions that closely resembled the beta distributions after the inverse logit transformation. Starting with $\beta_0^\alpha$, which is on the log-odds scale, the $\text{Normal}(-2.55, 1)$ prior comes close to the $\text{Beta}(1, 9)$ distribution after the inverse logit transformation. Here's a plot comparing the two.

```{r, fig.width = 6.25, fig.height = 3.75}
# left
p1 <- prior(beta(1, 9)) %>% 
  parse_dist() %>% 

  ggplot(aes(xdist = .dist_obj)) +
  stat_halfeye(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = c(.5, .95),
               fill = light_color_barbie,
               color = dark_color_barbie) +
  scale_x_continuous(expression(alpha), breaks = 0:5 / 5, limits = 0:1) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  labs(title = "Beta(1, 9)",
       subtitle = "From the unconditional model")

# right
n_draw <- 1e6

set.seed(1)

p2 <- tibble(p = rnorm(n = n_draw, mean = -2.55, sd = 1) %>% 
         plogis()) %>% 

  ggplot(aes(x = p)) +
  stat_histinterval(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = c(.5, .95),
                    fill = light_color_barbie,
                    color = dark_color_barbie,
                    align = ggdist::align_boundary(at = 0),
                    breaks = ggdist::breaks_fixed(width = 0.01)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expression(logit^{-1}*(beta[0]^alpha)), breaks = 0:5 / 5, limits = 0:1) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  labs(title = expression(logit^{-1}*"[Normal(-2.55, 1)]"),
       subtitle = "From the conditional model")

# combine 
p1 + p2 &
  plot_annotation(title = "After inverse logit transformation, Normal(-2.55, 1) on the log-odds\nscale is similar to Beta(1, 9) on the probability scale.") &
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        title = element_text(size = 12, color = text_color_barbie))
```

In a simlar way with our new $\beta_0^\gamma$ parameter, which is also on the log-odds scale, the $\text{Normal}(0. 0.67)$ prior comes close to the $\text{Beta}(5, 5)$ distribution after the inverse logit transformation. Here's a plot comparing the two.

```{r, fig.width = 6.25, fig.height = 3.75}
# left
p3 <- prior(beta(5, 5)) %>% 
  parse_dist() %>% 

  ggplot(aes(xdist = .dist_obj)) +

         plogis()) %>% 

  ggplot(aes(x = p)) +
  stat_histinterval(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = c(.5, .95),
                    fill = light_color_barbie,
                    color = dark_color_barbie,
                    align = ggdist::align_boundary(at = 0),
                    breaks = ggdist::breaks_fixed(width = 0.01)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expression(logit^{-1}*(beta[0]^gamma)), breaks = 0:5 / 5, limits = 0:1) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  labs(title = expression(logit^{-1}*"[Normal(0, 0.67)]"),
       subtitle = "From the conditional model")

# combine 
p3 + p4 &
  plot_annotation(title = "After inverse logit transformation, Normal(0. 0.67) on the log-odds\nscale is similar to Beta(5, 5) on the probability scale.") &
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        title = element_text(size = 12, color = text_color_barbie))
```

When it comes to fitting the model with `brm()`, we want to use the `0 + Intercept` syntax to accommodate how our various dummy variables are not mean centered. Also, note our use of the `bf()` function which allows for distributional modeling. Otherwise, the main thing to watch out for is that you make careful use of the `dpar` arguments when setting the priors.

```{r fit3}
fit3 <- brm(
  data = gaffney2022,
  family = zero_one_inflated_beta(),
  bf(T2Action ~ 0 + Intercept + signal + vignette + signal:vignette + s(T1Actionz),
     phi ~ 0 + Intercept + signal + vignette + signal:vignette + s(T1Actionz),
     zoi ~ 0 + Intercept + signal + vignette + signal:vignette + s(T1Actionz),
     coi ~ 0 + Intercept + signal + vignette + signal:vignette + s(T1Actionz)),
  # priors for the log-odds mu model
  prior = prior(normal(0, 1.25), class = b, coef = Intercept) +
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = b) +
    prior(exponential(1), class = sds) +
    # log(phi) model
    prior(normal(3.837813, 0.3852532), class = b, coef = Intercept, dpar = phi) +
    prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b, dpar = phi) +
    prior(exponential(2), class = sds, dpar = phi) +
    # log-odds zoi model
    prior(normal(-2.55, 1), class = b, coef = Intercept, dpar = zoi) +
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = b, dpar = zoi) +
    prior(exponential(1), class = sds, dpar = zoi) +
    # log-odds coi model
    prior(normal(0, 0.67), class = b, coef = Intercept, dpar = coi) +
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = b, dpar = coi) +
    prior(exponential(1), class = sds, dpar = coi),
  cores = 4, seed = 1,
  file = "fits/fit3.gaffney2022"
)
```

You might check the model summary. Given the large number of parameters, I will omit this output for the sake of space.

```{r, eval = F}
print(fit3)
```

However, we might make a faceted histogram of our three chain diagnostic statistics to help examine the quality of the model.



```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2.75}
as_draws_df(fit3) %>% 
  summarise_draws() %>% 
  pivot_longer(rhat:ess_tail) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = light_color_barbie, color = NA) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = 0.2)) +
  ggtitle("fit3 diagnostics") +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free_x")
```

#### Hierarchical ANCOVA.
  
Our second primary model will be a distributional ZOIB hierarchical ANCOVA. Before we describe the statistical model with an equation, we'll first show the basic linear model, excluding the baseline covariate, in the `lm()`-style design formula format:

`T2Action ~ 1 + (1 | signal) + (1 | vignette) + (1 | signal:vignette)`

This simple version is what you might call a hierarchical ANOVA, as proposed by Gelman (2005; https://doi.org/10.1214/009053604000001048). Here both factor variables are included as separate random effects, and the interaction between the two factors is treated as a third random effect. This structure will impose multilevel partial pooling, resulting in slightly conservative group differences. When one adds one or more baseline covariates to this, following the form

`T2Action ~ 1 + covariate(s) + (1 | signal) + (1 | vignette) + (1 | signal:vignette)`

this becomes what you might call a hierarchical ANCOVA. For some practice with these model types, Kruschke worked through examples of Bayesian hierarchical ANOVA's and ANCOVA's in the latter chapters of his 2014 [textbook](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/). Our approach will be to generalize further by fitting a fully distributional hierarchical ANCOVA, as applied to all four parameters of the ZOIB likelihood. Our generic linear predictor $\eta$ will follow the form

$$
\begin{align*}
\eta & = \beta_0 + f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) + u_{0j} + v_{0k} + w_{0jk} \\
f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) & = \beta_1 \text{T1Actionz}_i + z_l b_l, \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, L\ \text{basis terms}\ (b) \\
z_j & \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_z) \\
\begin{bmatrix} u_{0j}^\mu, u_{0j}^\phi, u_{0j}^\alpha, u_{0j}^\gamma \end{bmatrix}^\intercal & \sim \text{Normal}( 
  \mathbf 0, \mathbf S_u \mathbf R_u \mathbf S_u ), \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, J\ \text{ levels of the signal factor} \\
\begin{bmatrix} v_{0k}^\mu, v_{0k}^\phi, v_{0k}^\alpha, v_{0k}^\gamma \end{bmatrix}^\intercal & \sim \text{Normal}( 
  \mathbf 0, \mathbf S_v \mathbf R_v \mathbf S_v ), \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, K\ \text{ levels of the vignette factor} \\
\begin{bmatrix} w_{0jk}^\mu, w_{0jk}^\phi, w_{0jk}^\alpha, w_{0jk}^\gamma \end{bmatrix}^\intercal & \sim \text{Normal}( 
  \mathbf 0, \mathbf S_w \mathbf R_w \mathbf S_w ), \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, JK\ \text{ levels of the signal-vignette interaction},
\end{align*}
$$

where $\beta_0$ is now the population grand mean across the various levels of the `signal` and `vignette` factors, and the fixed effect for the smooth function for the `T1Actionz` covariate is now $\beta_1$. The new $u_{0j}$ term is the average deviation for the $j$th level of `signal` from the grand mean. In a similar way, the new $v_{0k}$ term is the average deviation for the $k$th level of `vignette` from the grand mean. The new $w_{0jk}$ term allows for a `signal` and `vignette` interaction in the deviations from the grand mean. As is typical, we model these upper-level deviations with zero-mean Gaussian distributions. Given our distributional model format, the lines of the linear predictor show we are allowing the $u_{0j}$ deviations to correlate across the ZOIB parameters which results in a $4 \times 4$ variance covariance matrix, which we decompose into $4 \times 4$ diagonal matrices of standard deviations $(\mathbf S_u)$, and $4 \times 4$ symmetric correlation matrices $(\mathbf R_u)$. The fifth and sixth lines in the linear predictor show we allow for the analogous structure for the $v_{0k}$ and $w_{0jk}$ deviations.

Thus, we might express the full distributional ZOIB hierarchical ANCOVA as

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{T2Action}_i & \sim \text{ZOIB}(\mu_i, \phi_i, \alpha_i, \gamma_i) \\
\text{logit}(\mu_i)    & = \eta^\mu \\
\log(\phi_i)           & = \eta^\phi \\
\text{logit}(\alpha_i) & = \eta^\alpha \\
\text{logit}(\gamma_i) & = \eta^\gamma, \;\;\; \text{where} \\
\eta & = \beta_0 + f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) + u_{0j} + v_{0k} + w_{0jk} \\
f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) & = \beta_1 \text{T1Actionz}_i + z_l b_l, \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, L\ \text{basis terms}\ (b) \\
z_j & \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_z) \\
\begin{bmatrix} u_{0j}^\mu, u_{0j}^\phi, u_{0j}^\alpha, u_{0j}^\gamma \end{bmatrix}^\intercal & \sim \text{Normal}( 
  \mathbf 0, \mathbf S_u \mathbf R_u \mathbf S_u ), \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, J\ \text{ levels of the signal factor} \\
\begin{bmatrix} v_{0k}^\mu, v_{0k}^\phi, v_{0k}^\alpha, v_{0k}^\gamma \end{bmatrix}^\intercal & \sim \text{Normal}( 
  \mathbf 0, \mathbf S_v \mathbf R_v \mathbf S_v ), \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, K\ \text{ levels of the vignette factor} \\
\begin{bmatrix} w_{0jk}^\mu, w_{0jk}^\phi, w_{0jk}^\alpha, w_{0jk}^\gamma \end{bmatrix}^\intercal & \sim \text{Normal}( 
  \mathbf 0, \mathbf S_w \mathbf R_w \mathbf S_w ), \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, JK\ \text{ levels of the signal-vignette interaction} \\
\beta_0^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1.25) \\
\beta_0^\phi & \sim \text{Normal}(3.837813, 0.3852532) \\
\beta_0^\alpha & \sim \text{Normal}(-2.55, 1) \\
\beta_0^\gamma & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.67) \\
\beta_1^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\beta_1^\phi & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.5) \\
\beta_1^\alpha & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\beta_1^\gamma & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\sigma_z^\mu & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma_z^\phi & \sim \text{Exponential}(2) \\
\sigma_z^\alpha & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma_z^\gamma & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma_u^\mu, \sigma_v^\mu, \sigma_w^\mu & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma_u^\phi, \sigma_v^\phi, \sigma_w^\phi & \sim \text{Exponential}(2) \\
\sigma_u^\alpha, \sigma_v^\alpha, \sigma_w^\alpha & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma_u^\gamma, \sigma_v^\gamma, \sigma_w^\gamma & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\mathbf R & \sim \text{LKJ}(2),
\end{align*}
$$

where we see the priors starting in line 12. We retain the intercept priors and regularizing smooth priors from the previous model. The priors for the new $\sigma$ parameters follow the same default weakly-regularizing ethos. We use the $\text{LKJ}(2)$ prior for the $(\mathbf R)$ correlation matrices, which will pull the correlations a bit towards zero.

Here's how to fit the model with `brm()`. Notice our use of the `|<ID>|` syntax which allows for correlations across the models for the four distributional parameters.

```{r fit4}
fit4 <- brm(

```

You might check the model summary. Given the large number of parameters, I will omit this output for the sake of space.

```{r, eval = F}
print(fit4)
```

However, we might make a faceted histogram of our three chain diagnostic statistics to help examine the quality of the model.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2.75}
as_draws_df(fit4) %>% 
  summarise_draws() %>% 
  pivot_longer(rhat:ess_tail) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = light_color_barbie, color = NA) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = 0.2)) +
  ggtitle("fit4 diagnostics") +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free_x")
```

On the whole, the diagnostics look fine, but a few of the parameters have low ESS values. If you check, these are a few of the upper-level $\sigma$ and $\rho$ parameters. Given there are only 4, 5, or 20 levels in the three grouping variables, it's no surprise we have some difficulties with those parameters.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
as_draws_df(fit4) %>% 
  posterior::summarise_draws() %>% 
  select(variable, ess_bulk:ess_tail) %>% 
  data.frame() %>%
  mutate_if(is.double, round, digits = 0) %>% 
  filter(ess_bulk < 1001)

as_draws_df(fit4) %>% 
  posterior::summarise_draws() %>% 
  select(variable, ess_bulk:ess_tail) %>% 
  data.frame() %>%
  mutate_if(is.double, round, digits = 0) %>% 
  filter(ess_tail < 1001)
```

#### Fixed effects ANCOVA with an ordinal factor.

A major limitation in our previous two models is they both treated the `signal` factor as if it was nominal. However, Gaffney and colleagues designed `signal` to be ordinal. We can even see this in the structure of the data itself.

```{r}
gaffney2022 %>% 
  select(signal) %>% 
  str()
```

Note how the `signal` vector is an *ordered* factor. **brms** allows users to capture the ordinal nature of such a predictor with monotonic effects, which B√ºrkner outlined the issue in his (2023) vignette, [*Estimating monotonic effects with with brms*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brms/vignettes/brms_monotonic.html), and in his (2020; https://doi.org/10.1111/bmsp.12195) article with Emmanuel Charpentier, *Modelling monotonic effects of ordinal predictors in Bayesian regression models*. Ben-Shachar recently discussed this topic in a very nice (2023) blog post called [*Order constraints in Bayes models (with brms)*](https://blog.msbstats.info/posts/2023-06-26-order-constraints-in-brms/), and McElreath covered ordinal predictor variables in Section 12.4 of his (2020) [textbook](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). Before we describe the statistical model with an equation, we'll first show the basic linear model, excluding the baseline covariate, in the `lm()`-style design formula format:

`T2Action ~ 1 + mo(signal) + vignette + mo(signal):vignette`

The **brms** package includes an `mo()` helper function, the name for which stands for *monotonic*. A key assumption with the `mo()` approach is we expect the changes between adjacent categories of the ordered predictor to be consistently negative or positive across all categories, which is the definition of the term *monotonic* in this context. For a given predictor, the `mo()` function decomposes the monotonic effect into an (a) overall slope which is the average change across adjacent categories and (b) a simplex which defines the incremental change from each of the adjacent categories. If we denote the lowest ordinal category $0$ and the highest category $D$, we can express the full set of ordinal categories as $\{0, \dots, D \}$. Thus $D$ is equal to the number of categories minus $1$, and also equal to the number of differences between two adjacent categories. An additional parameter vector $\zeta$ contains the normalized distances between adjacent categories, with the constraint $\zeta_j \in [0, 1]$ and $\sum_{j = 1}^D \zeta_j = 1$. The linear predictor of this simple ANOVA with monotonic effects for `signal` would follow the form

$$
\begin{align*}
\eta & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_2 \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_4 \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_5 \text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_7 \text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) \text{vignette}_{4i}, \text{where} \\
\text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) & = D \sum_{j = 1}^{\text{signal}_i} \zeta_j,
\end{align*}
$$

where $\beta_1$ becomes the average effect for a one-category increase in the `signal` factor given the reference category for the `vignette` factor, and $\beta_5$ through $\beta_7$ become the difference in those effects for the other three non-reference categories of `vignette`. The notation of the $\text{mo}(x, \zeta)$ operator comes from B√ºrkner & Charpentier (2020). To add the smooth term for our baseline covariate to the model too, we expand the linear predictor to

$$
\begin{align*}
\eta & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_2 \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_4 \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_5 \text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_7 \text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + f(\text{T1Actionz}_i), \text{where} \\
\text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) & = D \sum_{j = 1}^{\text{signal}_i} \zeta_j \\
f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) & = \beta_8 \text{T1Actionz}_i + z_k b_k, \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, K\ \text{basis terms}\ (b) \\
z_k & \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma),
\end{align*}
$$

where now we index the elements in the $\zeta$ simplex vector with $j$, and we index the basis terms from our smooth function with $k$. Extrapolating, we might express the full model as

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{T2Action}_i & \sim \text{ZOIB}(\mu_i, \phi_i, \alpha_i, \gamma_i) \\
\text{logit}(\mu_i)    & = \eta^\mu \\
\log(\phi_i)           & = \eta^\phi \\
\text{logit}(\alpha_i) & = \eta^\alpha \\
\text{logit}(\gamma_i) & = \eta^\gamma, \;\;\; \text{where} \\
\eta & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_2 \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_4 \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + \beta_5 \text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) \text{vignette}_{2i} + \dots + \beta_7 \text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) \text{vignette}_{4i} \\
& \;\;\; + f(\text{T1Actionz}_i), \text{where} \\
\text{mo}(\text{signal}_i, \zeta) & = D \sum_{j = 1}^{\text{signal}_i} \zeta_j \\
f(\text{T1Actionz}_i) & = \beta_8 \text{T1Actionz}_i + z_k b_k, \;\;\; \text{for}\ 1, \dots, K\ \text{basis terms}\ (b) \\
z_k & \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma), \;\;\; \text{and we have the priors} \\
\beta_0^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1.25) \\
\beta_0^\phi & \sim \text{Normal}(3.837813, 0.3852532) \\
\beta_0^\alpha & \sim \text{Normal}(-2.55, 1) \\
\beta_0^\gamma & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.67) \\
\beta_1^\mu, \dots, \beta_8^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\beta_1^\phi, \dots, \beta_8^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.5) \\
\beta_1^\alpha, \dots, \beta_8^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\beta_1^\gamma, \dots, \beta_8^\mu & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\sigma^\mu & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma^\phi & \sim \text{Exponential}(2) \\
\sigma^\alpha & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\sigma^\gamma & \sim \text{Exponential}(1) \\
\boldsymbol{\zeta} & \sim \text{Dirichlet}(1, 1, 1, 1),
\end{align*}
$$

where we continue our practice of using the same structure of $\eta$ for all four ZOIB distributional parameters, though in principle one could fit models with varying structures for $\eta^\mu$, $\eta^\phi$, and so on, as desired. The priors are largely the same as in the fixed effects ANCOVA, with the notable new Dirichlet priors for the $\zeta$ vectors. The `brm()` default prior for our $\zeta$ simplex vectors is $\text{Dirichlet}(1, 1, 1, 1)$. The Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate generalization of the beta distribution. This prior has a hyperparameter vector the same length as $\zeta$, which is $4$ in the case of our `signal` variable. But setting all the hyperparameters to the same value, we are assuming all differences between adjacent categories are about the same, but with considerably uncertainty. We can get a sense of the $\text{Dirichlet}(1, 1, 1, 1)$ distribution by sampling from it with the `brms::rdirichlet()` function. Here we save those results and display them in a `stat_histinterval()` plot.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
get_prior(
  data = gaffney2022,
  family = zero_one_inflated_beta(),
  bf(T2Action ~ 0 + Intercept + mo(signal) + vignette2 + mo(signal):vignette2 + s(T1Actionz),
     phi ~ 0 + Intercept + mo(signal) + vignette2 + mo(signal):vignette2 + s(T1Actionz),
     zoi ~ 0 + Intercept + mo(signal) + vignette2 + mo(signal):vignette2 + s(T1Actionz),
     coi ~ 0 + Intercept + mo(signal) + vignette2 + mo(signal):vignette2 + s(T1Actionz))
)
```

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3.25}
# sample
dprior <- rdirichlet(n = 1e5, alpha = rep(1, times = 4)) %>% 
  # convert to a data frame and rename the columns
  data.frame() %>% 
  set_names(1:4) 

# wrangle
dprior %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  mutate(name  = name %>% as.double(),
         zeta = str_c("zeta[", name, "]")) %>% 
  
  # plot
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = zeta)) +
  stat_histinterval(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = c(.5, .95),
                    fill = light_color_barbie,
                    color = dark_color_barbie,
                    align = ggdist::align_boundary(at = 0),
                    breaks = ggdist::breaks_fixed(width = 0.02)) +
  scale_x_continuous("probability") +
  scale_y_discrete(NULL, labels = ggplot2:::parse_safe, 
                    expand = expansion(mult = 0.05)) +
  labs(title = "100,000 draws from Dirichlet(1, 1, 1, 1)")
```

Thus when you have $\text{Dirichlet}(1, 1, 1, 1)$, each of the four vectors is distributed as $\text{Beta}(1, 3)$, which has a mean of 0.25 and a concentration of 4. What might not be obvious with this visualization is that the four vectors are constrained such that each iteration must sum to $1$. To help clarify, here are the first six rows of the `dprior` data frame, with a new `sum` vector, which is the summation of the other four.

```{r}
dprior %>% 
  mutate(sum = `1` + `2` + `3` + `4`) %>% 
  head()
```

Before we fit the model with `brm()`, we'll need to make a new version of the `vignette` columns. The current version of **brms** will return an error if you attempt to include an interaction with an `mo()` term and a factor variable where the levels include spaces in the names. The virst level of `vignette`, for example, is `Basketball coach`, which contains a space between the words "Basketball" and "coach." To avoid this problem, we'll make a new variable `vignette2` which only retains the first words in each factor level. Here's the new variable and how it relates to the original.

```{r}
gaffney2022 <- gaffney2022 %>% 
  mutate(vignette2 = case_when(
    vignette == "Basketball coach" ~ "Basketball",
    vignette == "Brother-in-law" ~ "Brother",
    vignette == "Romantic partner" ~ "Romantic",
    vignette == "Thwarted marriage" ~ "Thwarted"))

# what?
gaffney2022 %>% 
  distinct(vignette, vignette2)
```

Finally, here's how to fit the model with `brm()`. Note how the $\zeta$ priors are of `class = simo`.

```{r fit5}
fit5 <- brm(
  data = gaffney2022,
  family = zero_one_inflated_beta(),
  bf(T2Action ~ 0 + Intercept + mo(signal) + vignette2 + mo(signal):vignette2 + s(T1Actionz),
     phi ~ 0 + Intercept + mo(signal) + vignette2 + mo(signal):vignette2 + s(T1Actionz),
     zoi ~ 0 + Intercept + mo(signal) + vignette2 + mo(signal):vignette2 + s(T1Actionz),
     coi ~ 0 + Intercept + mo(signal) + vignette2 + mo(signal):vignette2 + s(T1Actionz)),
  prior = prior(normal(0, 1.25), class = b, coef = Intercept) +
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = b) +
    prior(dirichlet(1), class = simo, coef = mosignal1) +
    prior(exponential(1), class = sds) +
    # log(phi) model
    prior(normal(3.837813, 0.3852532), class = b, coef = Intercept, dpar = phi) +
    prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b, dpar = phi) +
    prior(dirichlet(1), class = simo, coef = mosignal1, dpar = phi) +
    prior(exponential(2), class = sds, dpar = phi) +
    # log-odds zoi model
    prior(normal(-2.55, 1), class = b, coef = Intercept, dpar = zoi) +
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = b, dpar = zoi) +
    prior(dirichlet(1), class = simo, coef = mosignal1, dpar = zoi) +
    prior(exponential(1), class = sds, dpar = zoi) +
    # log-odds coi model
    prior(normal(0, 0.67), class = b, coef = Intercept, dpar = coi) +
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = b, dpar = coi) +
    prior(dirichlet(1), class = simo, coef = mosignal1, dpar = coi) +
    prior(exponential(1), class = sds, dpar = coi),
  cores = 4, seed = 1,
  file = "fits/fit5.gaffney2022"
)
```

You might check the model summary. Given the large number of parameters, I will omit this output for the sake of space.

```{r, eval = F}
print(fit5)
```

However, we might make a faceted histogram of our three chain diagnostic statistics to help examine the quality of the model.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2.75}
as_draws_df(fit5) %>% 
  summarise_draws() %>% 
  pivot_longer(rhat:ess_tail) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = light_color_barbie, color = NA) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = 0.2)) +
  ggtitle("fit5 diagnostics") +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free_x")
```

## Posterior-predictive checks

Before moving on to the causal estimands, we might practice scrutinizing the models with a couple posterior-predictive checks. First, we might check how the models did at a gross level with histogram-based `pp_check()` plots for each.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3.5}
set.seed(1)
pp_check(fit3, ndraws = 8, type = "hist", binwidth = 0.05) +
  ggtitle("Fixed effects")

set.seed(1)
pp_check(fit4, ndraws = 8, type = "hist", binwidth = 0.05) +
  ggtitle("Hierarchical")

set.seed(1)
pp_check(fit5, ndraws = 8, type = "hist", binwidth = 0.05) +
  ggtitle("Fixed effects with mo()")
```

On the whole, each model did a decent job simulating data resembling the sample data.


Often times we use one of the "_grouped" settings to see how the models do across the experimental conditions. However, the `type` argument can only take one variable at a time, and our experimental conditions are based on both `signal` and `vignette`. So instead, here's a `add_predicted_draws()`-based approach for hand-made posterior-predictive checks based on posterior-predictive means.

```{r, message = F, fig.width = 6.25, fig.height = 11}
# compute the sample means
T2Action_sample_means <- gaffney2022 %>% 
  group_by(signal, vignette) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(T2Action))

set.seed(1)

p1 <- gaffney2022 %>%
  add_predicted_draws(fit3) %>% 
  group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(.prediction)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = mean, y = signal)) +
  stat_histinterval(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = .95,
                    fill = light_color_barbie,
                    color = dark_color_barbie,
                    align = ggdist::align_boundary(at = 0),
                    breaks = ggdist::breaks_fixed(width = 0.02)) +
  geom_point(data = T2Action_sample_means,
             color = "black") +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ggtitle("Fixed effects") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0)) +
  facet_wrap(~ vignette)

set.seed(1)

p2 <- gaffney2022 %>%
  add_predicted_draws(fit4) %>% 
  group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(.prediction)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = mean, y = signal)) +
  stat_histinterval(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = .95,
                    fill = light_color_barbie,
                    color = dark_color_barbie,
                    align = ggdist::align_boundary(at = 0),
                    breaks = ggdist::breaks_fixed(width = 0.02)) +
  geom_point(data = T2Action_sample_means,
             color = "black") +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ggtitle("Hierarchical") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0)) +
  facet_wrap(~ vignette)

set.seed(1)

p3 <- gaffney2022 %>%
  add_predicted_draws(fit5) %>% 
  group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(.prediction)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = mean, y = signal)) +
  stat_histinterval(point_interval = mean_qi, .width = .95,
                    fill = light_color_barbie,
                    color = dark_color_barbie,
                    align = ggdist::align_boundary(at = 0),
                    breaks = ggdist::breaks_fixed(width = 0.02)) +
  geom_point(data = T2Action_sample_means,
             color = "black") +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  ggtitle("Fixed effects with mo()") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0)) +
  facet_wrap(~ vignette)

(p1 / p2 / p3) +
  plot_annotation(title = "Hand-made posterior-predictive check",
                  subtitle = "Each hist-interval is the distribution of means of 4,000 sythetic data sets. The balck\ndots mark the sample means.")
```

Though there are minor differences among the three models, all did an okay job recapturing the group means.

## Causal estimands

Okay, we're finally ready to use our three primary models to compute our causal estimands. For the first batch, we'll compute various versions of the average treatment effect (ATE; $\tau_\text{ATE}$). As we'll see, we're swimming in possible ATE's of interest with a $4 \times 5$ factorial design and part of the challenge for the research team is to keep track of which estimands they care about most. Since we're working with rich distributional models, we'll compute the differences in the proportion of zero's for our second batch of causal estimands. For our third and final batch, our causal estimands will be differences in the proportion of one's.

### Average treatment effects.

Because all three of our focal models are ANCOVA's using non-identity links, we'll need to compute our causal estimands with the standardization approach. In this content sketch, we'll do so primarily with a **tidybayes**-based workflow. As a first step, we'll want a counterfactual predictor grid where each case in the data has all possible combinations of the independent variables. We'll call our predictor grid `nd`.

```{r}
nd <- gaffney2022 %>% 
  select(MTurkID, T1Action, T1Actionz) %>% 
  cross_join(gaffney2022 %>% 
               distinct(signal, vignette, vignette2))

# what?
glimpse(nd)
```

Now each of the $N = 1{,}200$ cases in the data, along with their values for the `T1Action` covariate, have 20 rows in the `nd` data frame where each of those rows corresponds to one of the 20 unique combinations of the experimental factors. You can confirm this with `count()`.

```{r}
nd %>% 
  count(signal, vignette, vignette2)
```

If our only goal was to plot the results from one of the models, say the hierarchical ANCOVA `fit4`, this is what the workflow would look like.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
t0 <- Sys.time()

contrast_levels <- c("Crying - Verbal request", "Mild depression - Verbal request", "Depression - Verbal request", "Suicide attempt - Verbal request")

nd %>%
  # this line returns 99,200,000 rows 
  add_epred_draws(fit4) %>% 
  # the next two lines return 80,000 rows
  group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>% 
  summarise(.epred = mean(.epred))  %>% 
  # this line returns 64,000 rows
  compare_levels(.epred, by = signal, draw_indices = c("vignette", ".draw"), comparison = "control") %>% 
  # the next two lines return 16 rows
  group_by(vignette, signal) %>% 
  mean_qi(.epred) %>% 
  mutate(signal = factor(signal, levels = contrast_levels)) %>% 

  # finally plot
  ggplot(aes(x = .epred, xmin = .lower, xmax = .upper, y = signal)) +
  geom_pointrange(size = 1/4, linewidth = 3/4,
                  color = medium_color_barbie) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 0.6)) +
  labs(title = "Contrasts in signal, relative to the verbal request control (by vignette)",
       x = "difference in mean action rating",
       y = "signal contrast") +
  theme_barbie(barbie_font = FALSE) +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot") +
  facet_wrap(~ vignette)

t1 <- Sys.time()
t1-t0  # 31.87015 secs
```

```{r first_counterfactuals, fig.witdh = 6, fig.height = 3.25, message = F}
contrast_levels <- c("Crying - Verbal request", "Mild depression - Verbal request", "Depression - Verbal request", "Suicide attempt - Verbal request")

nd %>%
  # this line returns 99,200,000 rows 
  add_epred_draws(fit4) %>%

```

These are all versions of our $\tau_\text{ATE}$'s where the first level of `signal`, called `Verbal request`, is the reference condition to which all subsequent conditions were contrasted. The key parts of the computation code was how we set `comparison = "control"` within the `compare_levels()` function. Further, each contrast was computed separately within each of the four levels of `vignette`, which we accomplished with the `group_by(vignette, signal)` line that followed the `compare_levels()` code.

As a technical note, that code block took about half a minute to execute on my new 2023 MacBook Pro with that sweet M2 Max chip. The reason I annotated the data-wrangling part of the code was to give a sense of why. At various stages of the code block, we were computing and summarizing large numbers of rows. Plan your workflow accordingly.

Here we'll separate the data-wrangling step for all three primary models from the plotting step. We save the results of the computation and data wrangling stage as `couterfactual_e_deltas`.

```{r couterfactual_e_deltas, echo = F}
# save(couterfactual_e_deltas, file = "mis_objects/couterfactual_e_deltas.rda")

model_type <- c("FE", "HI", "FE mo()")
contrast_levels <- c("Crying - Verbal request", "Mild depression - Verbal request", "Depression - Verbal request", "Suicide attempt - Verbal request")

load(file = "mis_objects/couterfactual_e_deltas.rda")
```

```{r, eval = F}
model_type <- c("FE", "HI", "FE mo()")
contrast_levels <- c("Crying - Verbal request", "Mild depression - Verbal request", "Depression - Verbal request", "Suicide attempt - Verbal request")

couterfactual_e_deltas <- bind_rows(
  # FE
  nd %>% 
    select(MTurkID, signal, vignette, vignette2, T1Actionz) %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit3) %>% 
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>% 
    summarise(.epred = mean(.epred)),
  # HI
  nd %>% 
    select(MTurkID, signal, vignette, vignette2, T1Actionz) %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit4) %>% 
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>% 
    summarise(.epred = mean(.epred)),
  # FE mo()
  nd %>% 
    select(MTurkID, signal, vignette, vignette2, T1Actionz) %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit5) %>% 
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>% 
    summarise(.epred = mean(.epred))
) %>% 
  mutate(model = rep(model_type, each = n() / 3) %>% factor(levels = model_type)) %>% 
  compare_levels(.epred, by = signal, draw_indices = c("model", "vignette", ".draw"), comparison = "control") %>% 
  group_by(model, vignette, signal) %>% 
  mean_qi(.epred) %>% 
  mutate(signal = factor(signal, levels = contrast_levels))

# what?
print(couterfactual_e_deltas)
```

Now we plot the $\tau_\text{ATE}$ posteriors for all three models.

```{r, fig.witdh = 7, fig.height = 3.5, warning = F}
couterfactual_e_deltas %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = .epred, xmin = .lower, xmax = .upper, y = signal)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = lighter_color_barbie) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(color = model),
                  size = 1/4, linewidth = 3/4,
                  position = position_dodge(width = -0.7)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(light_color_barbie, medium_color_barbie, dark_color_barbie)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.1, 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Contrasts in signal, relative to the verbal request control (by vignette)",
       x = "difference in mean action rating",
       y = "signal contrast") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot") +
  facet_wrap(~ vignette)
```

The models all returned similar results, which you may or may not find reassuring. To my eye, there's something of a trend for more precise posteriors from the fixed-effects model with monotonic effects for `signal`. 

This particular set of contrasts, however, is only a subset of those on which we might want to focus. For example, if we instead set `comparison = "ordered"` within the `compare_levels()` function we'll get contrasts for adjacent levels within the `signal` factor. Here's what that looks like in code.

```{r, fig.witdh = 7, fig.height = 3.5, warning = F, message = F}
# note we've updated the contrast levels
contrast_levels <- c("Crying - Verbal request", "Mild depression - Crying", "Depression - Mild depression", "Suicide attempt - Depression")

model_type <- c("FE", "HI", "FE mo()")

bind_rows(
  # FE
  gaffney2022 %>%
    select(MTurkID, signal, vignette, vignette2, T1Actionz) %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit3) %>%
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>%
    summarise(.epred = mean(.epred)),
  # HI
  gaffney2022 %>%
    select(MTurkID, signal, vignette, vignette2, T1Actionz) %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit4) %>%
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>%
    summarise(.epred = mean(.epred)),
  # FE mo()
  gaffney2022 %>%
    select(MTurkID, signal, vignette, vignette2, T1Actionz) %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit5) %>%
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>%
    summarise(.epred = mean(.epred))
) %>%
  mutate(model = rep(model_type, each = n() / 3) %>% factor(levels = model_type)) %>%
  # this line is new
  compare_levels(.epred, by = signal, draw_indices = c("model", "vignette", ".draw"), comparison = "ordered") %>%
  group_by(model, vignette, signal) %>%
  mean_qi(.epred) %>%
  mutate(signal = factor(signal, levels = contrast_levels)) %>% 

  ggplot(aes(x = .epred, xmin = .lower, xmax = .upper, y = signal)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = lighter_color_barbie) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(color = model),
                  size = 1/4, linewidth = 3/4,
                  position = position_dodge(width = -0.7)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(light_color_barbie, medium_color_barbie, dark_color_barbie)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.1, 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Sequential contrasts in signal, relative to the previous level (by vignette)",
       x = "difference in mean action rating",
       y = "signal contrast") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0),
        plot.title.position = "plot") +
  facet_wrap(~ vignette)
```

I don't know that this contrast method is better than the previous one. They answer similar, but distinct, questions. If desired, you could even do a difference-in-differences type analysis by subtracting each of the `signal`-level contrasts from one of the levels of `vignette` from the corresponding contrasts from a different level of `vignette`. Let your substantive theories guide your analyses. But don't just compute all possible contrasts and only report the biggest ones. That's just a Bayesian ATE version of $p$-hacking, and it's a recipe for unreproducible research.

### Treatment effects for zero $(\tau_{\Pr(Y = 0)})$.

If you recall from above where we introduced the ZOIB likelihood, we learned we can compute the proportion of $0$'s with

$$
p_0 = \alpha (1 - \gamma).
$$

We can use this formula to compute causal estimands showing differences in the proportion of zero's between conditions. I'm not aware there is a formal notation for such an estimand in the causal inference literature, so I propose we call it $\tau_{\Pr(Y = 0)}$.

As a first step, we need to set `dpar = c("zoi", "coi")` within the `add_epred_draws()` function, which will return the linear predictions for the $\alpha_i$ and $\gamma_i$ portions of the model. Then we use the formula above to compute $p_{0i}$ for each case in the data, after which we aggregate, contrast, and summarize as above. Here are the results for the $\tau_{\Pr(Y = 0)}$ contrasts using the `comparison = "control"` method. First we compute and save.

```{r couterfactual_p0_deltas, echo = F}
# save(couterfactual_p0_deltas, file = "mis_objects/couterfactual_p0_deltas.rda")

contrast_levels <- c("Crying - Verbal request", "Mild depression - Verbal request", "Depression - Verbal request", "Suicide attempt - Verbal request")

load(file = "mis_objects/couterfactual_p0_deltas.rda")
```

```{r, eval = F}
# p0
contrast_levels <- c("Crying - Verbal request", "Mild depression - Verbal request", "Depression - Verbal request", "Suicide attempt - Verbal request")

couterfactual_p0_deltas <- bind_rows(
  # FE
  nd %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit3, dpar = c("zoi", "coi")) %>% 
    rename(alpha = zoi, 
           gamma = coi) %>% 
    mutate(p0 = alpha * (1 - gamma)) %>%
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>%
    summarise(p0 = mean(p0)),
  # HI
  nd %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit4, dpar = c("zoi", "coi")) %>%
    rename(alpha = zoi, 
           gamma = coi) %>% 
    mutate(p0 = alpha * (1 - gamma)) %>%
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>%
    summarise(p0 = mean(p0)),
  # FE mo()
  nd %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit5, dpar = c("zoi", "coi")) %>%
    rename(alpha = zoi, 
           gamma = coi) %>% 
    mutate(p0 = alpha * (1 - gamma)) %>%
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>%
    summarise(p0 = mean(p0))
) %>%
  mutate(model = rep(model_type, each = n() / 3) %>% factor(levels = model_type)) %>%
  # comparison = "control"
  compare_levels(p0, by = signal, draw_indices = c("model", "vignette", ".draw"), comparison = "control") %>%
  group_by(model, vignette, signal) %>%
  mean_qi(p0) %>%
  mutate(signal = factor(signal, levels = contrast_levels)) 
```

Now we plot.

```{r, fig.witdh = 7, fig.height = 3.5, warning = F}
couterfactual_p0_deltas %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = p0, xmin = .lower, xmax = .upper, y = signal)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = lighter_color_barbie) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(color = model),
                  size = 1/4, linewidth = 3/4,
                  position = position_dodge(width = -0.7)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -2:2 / 5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(light_color_barbie, medium_color_barbie, dark_color_barbie)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.5, 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Contrasts in signal, relative to the verbal request control (by vignette)",
       x = expression("difference in Pr(action = 0) "*(tau[Pr(italic(Y)==0)])),
       y = "signal contrast") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot") +
  facet_wrap(~ vignette)
```

For this class of causal estimands in this data set, the results look unimpressive. So it goes...

### Treatment effects for zero $(\tau_{\Pr(Y = 1)})$.

Generalizing, we also learned we can compute the proportion of $1$'s with the equation

$$
p_1 = \alpha\gamma.
$$

Much like we did with $p_0$, we can use this formula to compute causal estimands showing differences in the proportion of one's between conditions. I'm not aware there is a received notation for this an estimand either, so I propose we call it $\tau_{\Pr(Y = 1)}$. This time, we'll compute the contrasts using the `comparison = "ordered"` method, which will return contrasts for adjacent categories in `signal`. First we compute and save.

```{r couterfactual_p1_deltas, echo = F}
# save(couterfactual_p1_deltas, file = "mis_objects/couterfactual_p1_deltas.rda")

contrast_levels <- c("Crying - Verbal request", "Mild depression - Crying", "Depression - Mild depression", "Suicide attempt - Depression")

load(file = "mis_objects/couterfactual_p1_deltas.rda")
```

```{r, eval = F}
contrast_levels <- c("Crying - Verbal request", "Mild depression - Crying", "Depression - Mild depression", "Suicide attempt - Depression")

couterfactual_p1_deltas <- bind_rows(
  # FE
  nd %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit3, dpar = c("zoi", "coi")) %>% 
    rename(alpha = zoi, 
           gamma = coi) %>% 
    mutate(p1 = alpha * gamma) %>%
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>%
    summarise(p1 = mean(p1)),
  # HI
  nd %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit4, dpar = c("zoi", "coi")) %>%
    rename(alpha = zoi, 
           gamma = coi) %>% 
    mutate(p1 = alpha * gamma) %>%
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>%
    summarise(p1 = mean(p1)),
  # FE mo()
  nd %>%
    add_epred_draws(fit5, dpar = c("zoi", "coi")) %>%
    rename(alpha = zoi, 
           gamma = coi) %>% 
    mutate(p1 = alpha * gamma) %>%
    group_by(signal, vignette, .draw) %>%
    summarise(p1 = mean(p1))
) %>%
  mutate(model = rep(model_type, each = n() / 3) %>% factor(levels = model_type)) %>%
  # comparison = "ordered"
  compare_levels(p1, by = signal, draw_indices = c("model", "vignette", ".draw"), comparison = "ordered") %>%
  group_by(model, vignette, signal) %>%
  mean_qi(p1) %>%
  mutate(signal = factor(signal, levels = contrast_levels)) 
```

Now plot.

```{r, fig.witdh = 7, fig.height = 3.5, warning = F}
couterfactual_p1_deltas %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = p1, xmin = .lower, xmax = .upper, y = signal)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = lighter_color_barbie) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(color = model),
                  size = 1/4, linewidth = 3/4,
                  position = position_dodge(width = -0.7)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -2:2 / 5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(light_color_barbie, medium_color_barbie, dark_color_barbie)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.5, 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Sequential contrasts in signal, relative to the previous level (by vignette)",
       x = expression("difference in Pr(action = 1) "*(tau[Pr(italic(Y)==1)])),
       y = "signal contrast") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0),
        plot.title.position = "plot") +
  facet_wrap(~ vignette)
```

These results are slightly more exciting than those above, but they're still probably nothing to write home about. Even so, it's good to know about your options.
