# Code of conduct

I don't care if you come off as professional or not, but please try to be kind.

## Study suggestions

Please give study suggestions in the [Issues section](https://github.com/ASKurz/Experimental-design-and-the-GLMM/issues). I’m currently conceptually organizing studies by design type. To suggest a new study, first look through the existing issues to find any with designs that match your study. If the study you’d like to propose is based on one of those designs, just add a new comment within that issue. If your study doesn’t seem to fall into any of the designs with open issues, either add it to the closest issue or feel free to open a new issue named after the study design.

Good study suggestions will include clear identifiers, such as the full name of the article, the official DIO number, or a working hyperlink. To respect copyright issues, please DO NOT link to sources like Sci-Hub. Vague suggestions like “Smith (1993)” will be ignored.

## Code

All code in this project will be based on the [**R** ecosystem](https://cran.r-project.org/). I'm not looking for code contributions at this time. It's possible that will change sometime in the future.

### Code style.

I generally follow the recommendations in [*The tidyverse style guide*](https://style.tidyverse.org/), but I have a few quirky conventions of my own. If you plan on recommending a big chunk of code, **tidyverse** conventions are generally preferred.

## Credit

I have thanked my contributors by name in my previous ebooks. I hope to do the same for this book, but it’s unclear what format that will take.
